While simplified from the original work (available from [Fienen et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9BVFSGJ), the example is still similar to a \"real world\" application in that it includes Streamflow Routing and Lake Package boundary conditions, and specification of input through external text array files that are amenable to parameter estimation. \n",

    "Similar operations can be performed to produce text file arrays for other model properties. For example, Flopy can export a shapefile of the model grid, which can then be used in a GIS environment to compute zonal statistics of land surface elevations or to map other properties to the grid. Or text file arrays might be produced by parameter estimation software such as PEST. We list text file inputs together in the block below for easy reference. Broadly, these external files fall into two categories-- array files of spatially continuous values for each cell (with one file per layer or stress period), and tabular files of sparse input values (one per stress period) with location and attribute information (e.g. row/column/layer or node number, flux, elevation, stage, conductance, etc.). In the example below, hydraulic conductivity, recharge and cell top and bottom elevations are contained in arrays; specified heads along the model perimeter are contained in a table externally (e.g. through GIS) mapped to layer, row, column locations in the grid."
